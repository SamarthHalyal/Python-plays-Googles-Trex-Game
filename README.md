# Python-plays-Googles-Trex-Game
# ------------------------------

 This Application requires you to have cv2 python package installed on whatever python version you are using.
 Also the game should be placed at appropriate position on your machine as shown in the gif that is below the below one.


 A attempt to play the google trex game on chrome using python. It uses simple ideas of object detection using computer vision(cv2)
 and making the moves, right now the code only jumps over tree hurdles, may even become capable of ducking the birds in future or 
 anyone interested may pull the project or star it and develop it furthur to do so.

I have tweaked a bit of the actual code for the game to add the Jump button to be "w" instead of UP button and "s" instead of DOWN button 
to duck..
